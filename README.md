Still to add:
- [ ] COVID data overlay for surrounding zip codes
- [ ] COVID data planes fitted to ring around the user (prevent overlap, bring each zip closer so that they can be easily viewed by the user)
- [ ] Intermediate step telling the user "please make sure your phone is at eye level" for correct calibration
- [ ] Colored numbers based on severity of infection, spread, overall status in the area
- [ ] Logo above the "loading" message and at the top right when info is loaded and when scanning the area
